what do you mean when you told us to check if the url should be crawled or not
can i start crawling from the manual link?
do every page in the domain has a different robots.txt file?
how to overcome the pagerank bias?
Please note that this is a simplified example, and ideal random walk algorithms 
can involve more complex strategies and heuristics to achieve a truly uniform distribution of web pages.

can i design my own heuristics to achievea truly uniform distribution of web pages
can it be very simple or do you expect us to design a complex heuristic to acheive this

so i have a question about designing my own heuritic for sampling truly uniform distribution of web pages
can it be very simple or do you expect us to design a complex heuristic to acheive this

do you want our heuristic to be quite effiecnt as well 

how can i measure if my sampled urls are random enough
