. It will then be used
to estimate the quantities in question. The fraction
of sampled web pages that satisfy a predicate is an
estimate for the fraction of all web pages that would
satisfy the predicate

In order to produce a uniformly distributed sample
of web pages without an index of all web pages, we
will use ideas from the theory of random walks

It
is well known that random walks on regular 1 undirected graphs can provide a close to uniformly distributed sample of nodes. Unfortunately the web is
neither undirected, nor regular. We present a method
to simultaneously walk the web and a dynamically generated graph G. The graph G has a node for each web
page discovered on the web, but is regular and undirected. As the walk progresses it produces a close to
uniformly distributed sample of web pages.
